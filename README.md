# Udacity Blog Project

This project is for Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) course.

The requirements are you use your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style. Also, demonstrate responsive functionality of the blog on various screen sizes.

Instead of making a traditional blog, I decided to make a "wiki-like", using the popular game, [Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria_Wiki), as inspiration.

I've included five articles that briefly overview a few of the game's features.
